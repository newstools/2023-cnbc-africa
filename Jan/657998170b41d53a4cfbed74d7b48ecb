Boeing’s 747 is one the most recognizable planes to take to the skies with its iconic hump, four engines, extensive landing gear and sheer size. Since its first commercial flight in 1970, Boeing’s 747 jumbo jet has flown more than 3.5 billion passengers. But over the last few decades, airlines have looked for more ways to cut costs and to make airplanes more efficient. Two engine jets can now fly near the same capacity and further than older four engine planes like Boeing’s 747 and the Airbus A380. CNBC visited Boeing's Everett, Washington factory to see the last 747 roll off the production line. It will go to Atlas Air for cargo deliveries. 

CNBC takes a look at how the 747 changed aviation and what’s next for Boeing.
